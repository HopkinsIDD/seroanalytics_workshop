**Guide to the Seroanalytic Workshop files**

The following material is a training resource for learning seroanalytical methods, from understanding and pre-processing serological data to inferring transmission dynamics. The material consists of both lectures and labs and can be followed at your own pace. To execute the code from the labs, you will need to have R, and preferably RStudio, installed on your computer before starting.

We recommend going through the files listed in the order below. We also recommend downloading the entire repository to your computer and creating a directory with the same name *seroanalytics_workshop*, as some of the R scripts will call data and code files assuming they are saved in similarly named folders. Please find a description of the course material files below.

**Part 1: Introduction to the Seroanalytics Workshop**
- Lecture 1 (as pptx or pdf)
  - A course overview, use cases of serology, study designs in seroepidemiology, and laboratory assays, including multiplexed methods

**Part 2: Introduction to serological data analyses in R**
- Lecture 2 (as pptx or pdf)
  - A description of R vs. Rstudio, R script vs. R markdown, ‘wide’ vs. ‘long’ dataframes, and different types of data frames used in serology
- Lab 2a_Intro to R (as pdf or Rmd)
  - R code to practice useful functions that will be used in subsequent labs
- Lab 2b_Reading in Serological Data (as pdf or Rmd)
  - R code to understand the format of raw multiplexed serological data

**Part 3: Pre-processing serological data**
- Lecture 3 (as pptx or pdf)
  - A description of what is pre-processing, how to measure whether pre-processing is effective, and a pipeline for pre-processing data
- Lab 3 (as pdf or Rmd)
  - R code to implement a pre-processing pipeline 

**Part 4: Visualizing and standardizing serological data**
- Lecture 4 (as pptx or pdf)
  - An overview of how to visualize & standardize serological data
- Lab 4  (as pdf or Rmd)
  - R code to visualize and standardize data

**Part 5: Determining serostatus and estimating seroprevalence**
- Lecture 5 (as pptx or pdf)
  - Considerations for binarizing serological data, determining serostatus, and estimating seroprevalence
- Lab 5 (as pdf or Rmd)
  - R code to binarize to determine serostatus and estimate seroprevalence   

**Part 6: Inferring transmission dynamics from seroprevalence data**
- Lecture 6 (as pptx or pdf)
  - A look into how to infer past transmission from age-specific seroprevalence patterns, timing and magnitude of past outbreaks in non-endemic settings, and force of infection in endemic transmission settings
- Lab 6 (as pdf or Rmd)
  - R code to implement the serocatalytic model, infer timing and magnitude of past outbreaks, and estimate force of infection

**Extra Lectures: Serodynamics and longitudinal analyses**
- Serodynamics review (as pptx or pdf)
  - Review of methods using serological data to understand transmission dynamics and to determine disease exposure, including serocatalytic and more complex models
- Longitudinal serological analyses (as pptx or pdf)
  - Review on using longitudinal serological data to evaluate antibody kinetics and the value of analyzing quantitative titers

**Projects: Guided worksheets to aid research question and analytic plan development** 

These worksheets can be applied to your own serosurveillance data and can be completed concurrently with the above lectures and labs.
